# Todos & Outline

# Need a formalizing a test info exercise prompt. 

# move the categorization to later. Replace with the creating of a structured result to the generator.

## full solution needs rewrite to use existing modules.
## Needs twice

### May need a skip option if the generated code is not valid.
