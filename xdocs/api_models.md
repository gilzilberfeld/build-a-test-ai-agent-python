Here's what you need to know about free tier API access for your workshop:

## OpenAI Free Tier - **Important Update**

**Current Stzxatus (2024-2025):**
- OpenAI previously offered $18 in free credits for new accounts during the first 3 months
- However, users frequently report getting "You exceeded your current quota" errors even with supposedly free accounts
- Many users report not receiving the expected $5 free credit

**Reality Check:** OpenAI's free tier is unreliable for workshops. Most new accounts need a payment method added to work properly.

## Google AI Studio/Gemini API - **Much Better Option**

**Free Access:**
- Google AI Studio usage is completely free in all available regions
- The Gemini API offers a "free tier" with lower rate limits for testing purposes
- Up to 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 per day

**Key Benefits:**
- You can create a key for free with a few clicks in Google AI Studio
- As long as billing remains disabled on your Google Cloud account, you stay within the free tier
- Google is letting developers call the models completely free up to generous rate limits

## Workshop Recommendation

**For your 3-hour workshop, I'd strongly recommend Google AI Studio/Gemini API because:**
1. Truly free without payment method required
2. Generous rate limits (1,000 requests/day should handle a workshop)
3. Simple setup process
4. More reliable than OpenAI's free tier

**Setup for participants:**
1. Go to Google AI Studio (ai.google.dev)
2. Create free API key
3. Use immediately without billing setup

This gives you the most reliable free option for your workshop participants.
